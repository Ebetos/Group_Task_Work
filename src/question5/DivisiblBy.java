 Divisible by 3,5 15Write a program that can print the numbers between 1~ 100 that can be divisible by 3,5 and 15.if the number can be divisible by 3,5 and then it should be displayed in Divisible by 15â€™ sectionif the number can be divisible by 3 but can not be divisible by 15. then it should be only displayed in divisible by 3 sections.if the number can be divisible by 5 but can not be divisible by 15. then it should be only be displayed in the Divisible by 5 sections.ex:Output:Divisible by 15 15 30 45 60 75 90Divisible by 5 5 10 20 25 35 40 50 55 65 70 80 85 95 100
